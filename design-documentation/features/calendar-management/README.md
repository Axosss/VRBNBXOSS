# Calendar Management

## Overview

The Calendar Management feature provides a unified view of all reservations across multiple apartments, enabling property owners to visualize occupancy, identify conflicts, and coordinate operations effectively. This central coordination hub integrates with reservation and cleaning management.

## Feature Summary

**User Story:** As a property owner, I want to view all my reservations across multiple apartments in a unified calendar.

**Primary User Goals:**
- Visualize all reservations in a single, comprehensive calendar view
- Quickly identify availability gaps and booking conflicts
- Filter and focus on specific apartments or date ranges
- Access reservation details without leaving the calendar context
- Coordinate cleaning and maintenance scheduling around bookings

**Key Success Metrics:**
- Calendar load time < 2 seconds for 100+ reservations
- Filter/search response time < 200ms
- User engagement with calendar features > 80% daily active users
- Conflict identification accuracy > 99%
- Real-time update synchronization < 100ms

## Core UX Principles Application

### User Goals and Tasks
- **Primary Goal:** Comprehensive overview of rental property occupancy and availability
- **Secondary Goals:** Quick reservation access, conflict resolution, operational planning
- **Task Efficiency:** Multi-view calendar, instant filtering, contextual actions

### Information Architecture
- **Calendar Views:** Month, week, day views with appropriate information density
- **Filter System:** Apartment selection, date ranges, reservation status
- **Detail Access:** Quick-view overlays with full detail navigation

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Overview First:** Month view shows high-level occupancy patterns
- **Detail On Demand:** Week/day views reveal specific reservation information
- **Contextual Actions:** Relevant actions appear based on selection and context

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Occupancy Status:** Clear visual differentiation between booked, available, and conflict states
- **Apartment Identification:** Consistent color coding and labeling across views
- **Time Navigation:** Prominent, intuitive navigation controls

## User Personas Impact

### Primary Persona: Multi-Platform Property Owner (35-55 years)
- **Needs:** Clear occupancy overview, easy navigation, quick conflict identification
- **Pain Points:** Information overload, complex interfaces, missed scheduling conflicts
- **Solutions:** Clean visual design, intelligent defaults, proactive conflict warnings

### Secondary Persona: Property Management Professional (25-45 years)
- **Needs:** Multi-property management, team coordination, client reporting capability
- **Pain Points:** Context switching, manual coordination, reporting complexity
- **Solutions:** Advanced filtering, export capabilities, team collaboration features

## Technical Constraints & Opportunities

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient Queries:** PostgreSQL indexes optimize large dataset performance
- **Real-time Updates:** Supabase Realtime ensures live synchronization
- **Client-side Caching:** Smart caching reduces server requests
- **Progressive Loading:** Calendar loads incrementally for better perceived performance

### Integration Benefits
- **Unified Data Model:** Seamless integration with reservations and cleaning schedules
- **Conflict Detection:** Automatic identification of scheduling conflicts
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Live updates for team coordination
