# Calendar Management - User Journey Analysis

## User Experience Analysis

### Primary User Goal
**What users want to accomplish:** Gain comprehensive visibility into rental property occupancy across all apartments with ability to identify patterns, conflicts, and opportunities.

### Success Criteria

- **Efficiency Success:** Calendar information accessed and understood within 10 seconds

### Key Pain Points Addressed
1. **Fragmented Visibility:** Unified view eliminates platform switching
