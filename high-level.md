# Dashboard for a rental owner using : airbnb, vrbo platform and direct booking.
This app serves people who owns apartment(s) that they rent on short or middle term.
It helps them follow which apartment are rented, when, for how much and if a cleaning has been booked in between two bookings.
It also helps us see how much money was made, with a set of interesting stats.
It also helps show the apartement with its availabilities to agency. 
It helps renters with a page made just for them : showing infos, plan, wifi code, digicode... 

It has multiple sections : 
- calendar,
- reservations,
- stats,
- cleaning,
- contracts,
- appartement(s),
- settings

V2.0 : We will only focus later on the last too pages :
- showcase : show the apartment online to future guest and companies. Can make a direct booking request with the agenda.
- renters (we will need to come up with a better name):  share informations to people actually renting the apartment (wifi, digicode etc)

## Calendar : 
It shows the reservations per appartment like on the airbnb calendar 
Shows each reservation. 
When a reservation is hovered or clicked (mobile version) on the calendar, it shows more infos (based on reservation infos)
The agenda can be scrolled to previous or later month. 
Can show 1 or multiple appartment calendar. based on color for each. This choice is made by clicking on nice big round rectangle apartment bouton at the top of the page. With the appartment logo / profile pic.
Airbnb calendar is a great inspiration

## Reservations : 
Each reservation is in a card. 
Reservation can be deleted, modified, updated or added. 

### V2.0 : In a later version they will be fetched through Airbnb, Vrbo or any other website iCal. 
- This will require an update system (if the reservation has been canceled, or updated (date,hours,guests...))
- each ical has its own sets of infos. Airbnb is differents than Vrbo 
    -  we will need to see which has what, converts dates, hours, et populate with our existing infos. 
    Example : We have already added all the infos for a reservations (infos not included in the ical), then it is modified in Airbnb, we have to update it without removing the manually added infos.
- if a reservation is updated : how to spot which one (guest name? + dates?, reservation number?) : we will need to see the icals and check. (each platform will require its own system)
- alert system and a resolve center if we have overlapping bookings for the same apartment.
At the top of this page we have a container with important infos such as : 
- New guest coming in ... days / or today / or leaving. 
- Cleaning infos for the next ones : Next cleaning the 6th of august for *appartment01* 

//- an update container, at the top of the page, that tells us : x new bookings since y. z was modified etc. 
//And more important : next reservation (for each appartment) (if exist) and next cleaning(s).

The owner section is access to all the features.
The showcase section is a single page for each appartment so that i can share a link to people to look the appartment.
